# NYC Traffic Accident Analysis

This project involves analyzing a comprehensive traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The dataset, sourced from NYC Open Data, provides valuable insights into the frequency and severity of accidents across different conditions.

## Key Findings
- **Hourly Distribution:** Analyzed how the number of accidents varies throughout the day.
- **Weather Conditions:** Explored the impact of various weather conditions on accident occurrences.
- **Hotspot Visualization:** Created a heatmap to visualize accident hotspots across New York City.
- **Contributing Factors:** Investigated how contributing factors influence accident severity.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Pattern Analysis
- Geographical Visualization using Folium
- Heatmap Creation for Accident Hotspots

## Key Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)
- Data from NYC Open Data
